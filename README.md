# Football-Team-Cards
Learning modern javascript methods by building football team cards.

One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, I learned how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project covered concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more. Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
